The Saanich Youth Council wishes to address the issue of uninformed, apathetic community members

We believe that people are interested in municipal politics, but that the current sources of information are too diverse, infrequently updated, and hard to find. 

This website, therefore, is a central news and information hub for current events in Saanich. It is a Camosun College Capstone project.
